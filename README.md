Hello All! 

I'm hoping to become a really good programmer as the days and months go by! 
I know this is a tough challenge as i don't tend to stick and carry out my tasks from start to finish.
Lets see how well this goes. 

It's good to see that you recongise where you are going wrong. A lot of people don't!
The next part after realising is to challenge myself. I am not yet use to making big changes in your life.
but if you become consistent and keep trying, you might just make it.

Hopefully you come back to this and laugh! 

Wishing myself the best! 

Sunny
